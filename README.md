# chess-ai
This is the base Chess AI for competing in the CUWAI Chess competition.

To compete, fork this repository into your github account and
extend the logic inside of `ai.py`!

To test your AI you can run `main.py`, which contains
a simple text-based rendering of a game of chess for you to play
against your implementation.

# Dependencies
 - Python 3.7.3 or above
 - The python `chess` library.
This can be installed through the command line with ``pip3 install chess``

# Requirements
Your submission must contain (so you should not delete):
 - The `__init__.py` file
 - The `ai.py` file, with a function `make_move(chess.Board, float)`

Any and all other files are optional but can be referenced by your code,
so you may have as many other files as you want 
(as long as you stay under the size limit for submitting!)
